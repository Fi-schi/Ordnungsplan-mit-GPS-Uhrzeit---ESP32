# Organisation-plan-with-GPS-time---ESP32

The project displays on a screen an organisation plan for a flat shared by 3 people. 
Tasks rotate on a weekly basis. The current time and date are also displayed.

As the ESP32 is not to be connected to a WLAN network, a GPS module is used to obtain an accurate time.

The components:
- ESP32 Dev Module
- GY-NEO6MV2
- 2,42 Zoll 128x64 oled I2C SSD1309 Display
- 2x 4,7kOhm Resistors
